Analyze rock, paper, scissors for OOP modeling
This exercise is a modeling exercise. You'll be given a problem domain description. 
You'll then be asked to take out the important keywords from the text and arrange them in a table.

Problem description
Rock, paper, scissors is a game played by two participants. The game consists of rounds. In each round, a participant chooses a symbol from rock, paper, or scissors, and the other participant does the same. Then a winner of the round is determined by comparing the chosen symbols. The rules of the game state that rock wins over scissors, scissors beats (cuts) paper, and paper beats (covers) rock. The winner of the round is awarded a point. 
The game goes on for as many rounds as the participants agreed on. The winner is the participant with the most points.

Model the game
Copy and paste the preceding text into a document. Highlight the important keywords by making them bold or italic.

Tip:
Spend a few minutes trying to underline what you think are the important keywords. After you're finished, scroll down to text that highlights the important parts.

Here's the problem description text with highlights:

Next, create a table with the columns Phase, Actor, Behavior, and Data. Arrange the highlighted words where you think they should be placed.

 Tip

Spend a few minutes thinking this through, and scroll down after you've given it some thought.
